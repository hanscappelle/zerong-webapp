# Zerong

This is a simple web app for visualisation of Zero Motorcycles cloud data. Once you've provided
your zero login (the one used in the official zero app that is linked to your bike) you can
query your motorcycles cloud data in a generic way.

The app is hosted using firebase and available at https://zerong-a5759.web.app/

Below example is 12V battery voltage over time. The current version of this app will fetch
data for the last 20 days.

Feel free to share interesting data views you've found this way or issues or feature requests.

Since this is an angular app using material design this should also render on mobile devices. 
The graph will adapt to the screen size. For a better view of data on smaller screens make
sure to use the device in landscape.

# Development

## Initial project setup

(just for reference, only needed once)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.

With node and angular installed create a new project with below command & answer questions.

`ng new project-name`

Next go into the project folder to continue with the steps to add this project to firebase for hosting.

`firebase init`

Answer questions, pick at least `hosting` option from firebase. An existing project can be selected
or a new one created in this firebase/cli tool.

During the setup a question will popup about your public directory. Make sure to set it to
`dist/project-name` since that is where the build will be generated by angular by default.

Other options aren't that crucial. Most can be changed later in `firebase.json` config file anyway.

I noticed I always got an error that the location isn't configured for analytics. I have to manually
set it for each project in the firebase console online (I bet it's just a default somewhere). If needed
go to Firebase console > select your project > Project settings > General (tab) and edit
`Default GCP resource location`

After that you can host your app with

`ng build --aop`

`firebase deploy -m "commit message" --only hosting`

## Adding material 

Execute `ng add @angular/material` and answer questions. Pick a default theme or create your own. 

Add some components, see https://material.angular.io/components/categories

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
